 &nbsp &nbsp<p><h2> It was a really great experience while I made my website, which gave me a chance to show my own thought as well as learning lots of new knowledge. When I made my website, the first thing occurred to me was how to manage the layout of my website. For example, where should I put the photos? Where can I put the paragraphs without making it boring? etc. The theme of my website is the Dragon Lantern, which is a famous festival in my hometown. </h2></P>
 &nbsp &nbsp<p><h2>It was fantastic to put photos and video in the website to enhance the appearance. And to design the website properly, the color of some components such as navigation bar and menu bar should fit the theme. So I chose red as the main color. Apart from the layout and styles, the important thing is surely the content.I edited a simple introduction and description of different types of lantern in my hometown. And luckily, I could take advantage of my habit of photography. All the photos in website was taken by myself.
